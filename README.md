git pull (get things that others have commited)

write/modify code. 

add any file types to .gitignore (using gedit) that you don't want pushed. (examply you might make test.cpp, you can add this to .git ignore if you donn't want others to see it.)

run git status and see what it says. 

git add filenames.cpp(etc) if they are not tracked ^

git commit -a -m "usefull message"

git push
